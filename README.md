Live demo: https://martinsmeder.github.io/where_is_waldo/

A browser based Where's Waldo game, powered by firebase and webpack.

Some things I've learned:

- How to use GIMP to create transparent icons and compress image files
- How to store, retrieve, verify and display data using Firebase's Cloud Firestore
- How to render and remove content at the users clicked position
- How to structure code according to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- How to let the width and height of an image decide the size of the entire web page
